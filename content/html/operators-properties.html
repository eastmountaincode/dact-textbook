Operators</h1>
<p>Statistical operators are powerful tools that transform random
variables in systematic ways. In this chapter, we’ll explore two
fundamental operators: the expectation operator and the variance
operator. These operators will appear throughout the rest of this book,
so understanding their properties deeply will pay dividends as we tackle
more complex statistical concepts.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what an operator is in the statistical context</li>
<li>Calculate and interpret expected values</li>
<li>Calculate and interpret variances</li>
<li>Apply the properties of expectation and variance to simplify complex
expressions</li>
<li>Understand how these operators behave under linear
transformations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>An <strong>operator</strong> is a mapping that takes elements from
one space and produces elements in another space (which may be the same
space). In statistics, operators act on random variables to produce new
quantities.</p>
</section>
<p>Think of an operator as a special kind of function that acts on
random variables rather than on simple numbers. Just as the square root
function takes a number and returns another number, statistical
operators take random variables and return quantities that summarize key
features of those variables.</p>

<h2>Question: Why do we call them “operators” instead of just
“functions”?</h2>
<p>The term “operator” emphasizes that these mappings act on objects
(random variables) that are themselves functions. This distinguishes
them from ordinary functions that act on numbers. The expectation
operator, for instance, takes an entire probability distribution and
distills it down to a single number representing its center.</p>

<h3 id="intuition-and-definition">Intuition and Definition</h3>
<p>Intuitively, a random variable’s expected value represents the
average we would see if we observed many independent realizations of
that variable. For example, if we roll a fair six-sided die thousands of
times and compute the average of all the outcomes, that average will
converge to 3.5. This value—3.5—is the expected value of the die
roll.</p>

<h2>Definition: Expected Value</h2>
<p>The <strong>expected value</strong> (or <strong>expectation</strong>)
of a discrete random variable <span class="math inline">X</span> is the
probability-weighted average of all its possible values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i p_i
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">x_i</span> are the possible values
and <span class="math inline">p_i = \mathrm{P}(X = x_i)</span> are their
respective probabilities.</p>
</section>
<p>More generally, we can write this as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i X_i = \mu
</span></p>
<p>where we often use the Greek letter <span
class="math inline">\mu</span> (mu) to denote the expected value.</p>
<p>For continuous random variables, the sum becomes an integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x f(x) \, dx
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">f(x)</span> is the probability
density function of <span class="math inline">X</span>.</p>

<h2>Question: Can you give a concrete example of computing an expected
value?</h2>
<p>Consider a simple game where you flip a fair coin. If it lands heads,
you win $10; if it lands tails, you lose $5. What are your expected
winnings?</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">X</span> represent your winnings.
Then:</p>
<p>$$ [X] = 10</p>
