mean</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore three fundamental properties of
statistical estimators that form the backbone of statistical inference.
We’ll prove that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the
population mean, demonstrate that it’s the most efficient among all
unbiased estimators, and examine why the sample variance requires a
correction factor. These proofs are not merely mathematical
exercises—they reveal deep truths about how we can reliably learn about
populations from samples.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes an estimator “unbiased” and why this matters</li>
<li>How to compare estimators using the criterion of efficiency</li>
<li>Why the sample variance formula uses <span
class="math inline">n-1</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">n</span></li>
<li>The relationship between sample statistics and population
parameters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-unbiasedness-of-the-sample-mean">The Unbiasedness of the
Sample Mean</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a fundamental question that underlies all of
statistical inference.</p>
<section id="question" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>How do we know that the sample mean is a reliable estimator of the
population mean? Could there be systematic error in our estimates?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer" class="callout-tip" data-icon="false"
data-collapse="true">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The sample mean is <strong>unbiased</strong>, meaning that if we
could take infinitely many samples and calculate the mean for each one,
the average of all those sample means would exactly equal the population
mean. This property holds regardless of sample size or the shape of the
population distribution—it’s assumption-free except for requiring that
the population mean is finite.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-unbiasedness">Understanding Unbiasedness</h3>
<p>An estimator is <strong>unbiased</strong> if its expected value
equals the parameter it’s trying to estimate. For the sample mean <span
class="math inline">\bar{Y}</span> estimating the population mean <span
class="math inline">\mu</span>, we want to show:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
E[\bar{Y}] = \mu
</span></p>
<p>This is a powerful property because it guarantees that our estimator
has no systematic tendency to overestimate or underestimate the true
parameter. Some samples will give us values above <span
class="math inline">\mu</span>, others below, but on average—across
infinitely many samples—we hit the target exactly.</p>
<h3 id="the-proof">The Proof</h3>
<p>The proof is remarkably elegant. Let’s work through it step by
step.</p>
<p>We start with the definition of the sample mean:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\bar{Y} = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + \cdots + Y_n}{n}
</span></p>
