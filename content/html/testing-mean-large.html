<h1 id="sec-hypothesis-testing">Testing a claim about a population
mean</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll develop a comprehensive understanding of
hypothesis testing through a detailed worked example. We’ll build the
theoretical foundation step by step, introducing key concepts like
standard error, test statistics, and p-values along the way. By the end
of this chapter, you will understand how to conduct hypothesis tests for
population means, interpret their results, and recognize the crucial
differences between large and small sample tests.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-evaluating-a-new-curriculum">The Problem: Evaluating
a New Curriculum</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with a concrete problem that will guide our exploration
of hypothesis testing. Suppose we’re trying to improve the logical
ability of students through a new curriculum. The old curriculum, which
has been in use for many years, produces an average test score of 80
points. We’ve developed a new curriculum and trained a large group of
students using this approach.</p>
<p>The central question we want to answer is: <strong>Is the new
curriculum more effective at raising average test scores?</strong></p>
<p>To investigate this question, we randomly sample 38 students from
those trained under the new curriculum and record their test scores. Our
sample yields a mean score of 83 points.</p>

data-icon="false">
<h2>🤔 Initial Observation</h2>
<p>While our sample mean of 83 is higher than the old curriculum mean of
80, we cannot immediately conclude that the population mean of all
students trained under the new curriculum exceeds 80. Why not? Because
our sample is just one of many possible samples we could have drawn, and
sample means vary due to random sampling.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="the-logic-of-hypothesis-testing">The Logic of Hypothesis
Testing</h3>
<p>Frequentist hypothesis testing operates on a principle analogous to
<strong>proof by contradiction</strong> in mathematics. We temporarily
assume the opposite of what we hope to demonstrate, then show that this
assumption leads to implausible results.</p>

<p>The intuition is straightforward: we set up a hypothesis about a
population parameter, assume it’s correct, then calculate the
conditional probability of observing our sample data. If this
probability is sufficiently small, we reject the hypothesis.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-standard-error">Understanding Standard Error</h2>
<p>Before we can conduct a proper hypothesis test, we need to understand
a crucial concept: <strong>standard error</strong>.</p>
<section id="what-is-standard-error" class="callout-important"
data-icon="false">
<h2>💡 What is Standard Error?</h2>
<p>Standard error measures how far, <strong>on average</strong>, a
sample mean deviates from the population mean across repeated samples.
It quantifies the precision of our estimator.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the standard error of the sample mean is: <span
class="math display">
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
</span> where <span class="math inline">\sigma</span> is the population
standard deviation and <span class="math inline">n</span> is the sample
size.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="the-concept-of-repeated-sampling">The Concept of Repeated
Sampling</h3>
<p>To truly understand standard error, we need to embrace a core
principle of frequentist statistics: <strong>repeated sampling</strong>.
Imagine we could draw not just one sample of 38 students, but millions
of such samples from our population. Each sample would give us a
different sample mean.</p>
<p>Here’s the remarkable thing: if we computed all these sample means
and calculated their average, that average would equal the true
population mean. This property is called <strong>unbiasedness</strong>,
and it’s why we use the sample mean as our estimator.</p>
<p>But these individual sample means would vary around the population
mean. The standard error tells us the typical size of this variation. In
our example, with a sample size of 38 and a calculated standard error of
1.64 points, we know that a typical sample mean deviates from the
population mean by about 1.64 points.</p>
<section id="key-insight" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>🎯 Key Insight</h2>
<p><strong>Smaller standard error = More precision = Greater
reliability</strong></p>
<p>When the standard error is small, we can be more confident that our
single observed sample mean is close to the true population mean. The
standard error decreases as sample size increases, which is why larger
samples give us more reliable estimates.</p>
</section>
<h3
id="the-relationship-population-variance-to-sample-mean-variance">The
Relationship: Population Variance to Sample Mean Variance</h3>
<p>There’s a fundamental relationship connecting the population variance
to the variance of the sample mean:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\text{Var}(\bar{Y}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
</span></p>
<p>Taking the square root of both sides gives us the standard error
formula. This relationship tells us that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The variance of sample means is smaller than the population
variance</li>
<li>This variance decreases as sample size increases</li>
<li>The relationship is inverse with sample size (doubling <span
class="math inline">n</span> doesn’t double precision)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-three-stages-of-hypothesis-testing">The Three Stages of
Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>Now that we understand standard error, we can proceed with our
hypothesis test. We’ll work through this systematically in three
stages.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Stage I: Setup</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first step in any hypothesis test is to clearly state what we’re
testing. We need two competing hypotheses.</p>

<p><strong>Complement:</strong> Students trained under the new
curriculum will not score, on average, higher than 80 on the test.</p>
<h4 id="the-law-of-the-excluded-middle">The Law of the Excluded
Middle</h4>
<p>In formulating our hypotheses, we’re invoking a fundamental principle
of logic: the <strong>law of the excluded middle</strong>.</p>

<p>This law states that a statement is either true or false—there is no
middle ground between truth and falsity. Either the new curriculum
improves scores beyond 80, or it doesn’t. Our job is to determine which
is more likely given our data.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis represents the status quo or the claim we’re
trying to find evidence against. The alternative hypothesis represents
what we hope to demonstrate with our data. By convention, we assign the

attempt to falsify.</p>
<p>We also need to choose a <strong>significance level</strong> <span

making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). Let’s set
<span class="math inline">\alpha = 0.04</span> or 4%.</p>
<section id="why-this-setup" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>📊 Why This Setup?</h2>
<p>Notice that our null hypothesis includes the equality. This is a
one-sided test because we’re only interested in whether the new
curriculum is <em>better</em>, not just different. If we cared about any
difference (better or worse), we’d use a two-sided test.</p>
</section>
<h4 id="understanding-type-i-and-type-ii-errors">Understanding Type I
and Type II Errors</h4>
<p>Before proceeding, we must acknowledge that hypothesis testing
involves the possibility of error. There are two types of errors we
might make:</p>

<h3 id="stage-2-estimating-the-sampling-distribution">Stage 2:
Estimating the Sampling Distribution</h3>
<p>In this stage, we need to characterize the distribution of our test
statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choose an Estimator</strong></p>
<p>We use the sample mean <span class="math inline">\bar{Y}</span> as
our estimator of the population mean <span
class="math inline">\mu</span>. Our observed value is <span
class="math inline">\bar{y} = 83</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establish the Distribution</strong></p>
<p>The sample mean is itself a random variable. With our large sample
size (<span class="math inline">n = 38</span>), we can invoke the
<strong>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</strong>, which tells us that the
sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\bar{Y}</span> is
approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population
distribution.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\bar{Y} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)
</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Estimate the Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis, we assume <span class="math inline">\mu
\leq 80</span>. For the purposes of constructing our test, we’ll use
<span class="math inline">\mu = 80</span> as the boundary value (the
null hypothesis “at its most extreme”).</p>
<p>From our sample data, we calculate: - Sample standard deviation:
<span class="math inline">s = 10.1</span> points - Standard error: <span
class="math inline">SE = s/\sqrt{n} = 10.1/\sqrt{38} \approx 1.64</span>
points</p>
<section id="the-sampling-distribution" class="callout-important"
data-icon="false">
<h2>💡 The Sampling Distribution</h2>
<p>We now have a complete picture of the sampling distribution under
<span class="math inline">H_0</span>: <span class="math display">
\bar{Y} \sim N(80, 1.64^2)
</span></p>
<p>This means if the null hypothesis is true, sample means from repeated
samples would be normally distributed around 80 with a standard
deviation of 1.64.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>Visualizing the Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a bell curve centered at 80. This represents all possible
sample means we could observe if the true population mean were 80. Some
sample means would be less than 80, some greater, but they’d cluster
around 80 with most values falling within a few standard errors of the
center.</p>
<p>Our observed sample mean of 83 lies to the right of this center. The
question is: is it far enough to the right that we should doubt the null
hypothesis?</p>
<h3 id="stage-3-computing-the-test-statistic-and-p-value">Stage 3:
Computing the Test Statistic and P-value</h3>
<p>To answer our question, we need to standardize our observed value and
determine how unusual it is.</p>
<p><strong>The Test Statistic: Zeta (ζ)</strong></p>
<p>We define a test statistic called zeta (ζ) as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\zeta = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{SE}
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\mu_0</span> is the hypothesized
population mean under the null (80 in our case).</p>
<p>This standardization accomplishes two things: 1. It converts our
result to a <strong>unit-free measure</strong> 2. It tells us
<strong>how many standard errors</strong> our observed mean is from the
hypothesized mean</p>
<section id="interpretation-of-ζ" class="callout-note"
data-icon="false">
<h2>🎯 Interpretation of ζ</h2>
<p>The value of ζ represents the number of standard deviations (or
standard errors) that the observed sample mean is from the hypothesized
population mean.</p>
<p>If our observed sample had a mean of 83 kg, the population mean were
80 kg, and the standard error were 1.64 kg, then: <span
class="math display">
\zeta = \frac{83 - 80}{1.64} = 1.83
</span></p>
<p>The “kg” units cancel out, leaving us with a pure number: 1.83
standard errors above the hypothesized mean.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>Calculating Our Test Statistic</strong></p>
<p>For our problem: <span class="math display">
\zeta = \frac{83 - 80}{1.64} = \frac{3}{1.64} \approx 1.83
</span></p>
<p>Our observed sample mean is 1.83 standard errors above the
hypothesized mean of 80.</p>
<p><strong>The Distribution of Zeta</strong></p>
<p>When the sample size is large and we know (or can estimate) the
population standard deviation, the test statistic ζ follows a
<strong>standard normal distribution</strong> (also called a
Z-distribution). This is the same as the Z-scores you may have
encountered before.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\zeta \sim N(0, 1)
</span></p>
<p><strong>Computing the P-value</strong></p>
<p>The p-value answers the question: “If the null hypothesis were true,
what is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as or
more extreme than what we actually observed?”</p>
<p>For our one-sided test: <span class="math display">
p\text{-value} = P(\zeta \geq 1.83 \mid H_0 \text{ is true})
</span></p>
<p>Using a standard normal table or software, we find: <span
class="math display">
p\text{-value} \approx 0.034 \text{ or } 3.4\%
</span></p>
<p><strong>Making the Decision</strong></p>
<p>We compare our p-value to our significance level: - p-value = 3.4% -
<span class="math inline">\alpha</span> = 4%</p>
<p>Since the p-value (3.4%) is less than our significance level (4%), we
<strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<section id="conclusion" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>📊 Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have sufficient evidence at the 4% significance level to conclude
that the new curriculum improves average test scores beyond 80. The
probability of observing a sample mean as high as 83 (or higher) purely
by chance, if the true population mean were 80 or less, is only
3.4%.</p>
</section>
<h2 id="visual-interpretation">Visual Interpretation</h2>
<p>Let’s visualize what we’ve done. Picture the sampling distribution
under the null hypothesis: a normal curve centered at 80 with standard
deviation 1.64. Our observed sample mean of 83 falls in the right tail
of this distribution.</p>
<p>The p-value is the area under this curve to the right of 83—it
represents how much of the distribution lies at or beyond our observed
value. This area is relatively small (3.4%), indicating that our
observation would be quite unusual if the null hypothesis were true.</p>
<h2 id="the-small-sample-case-when-n-30">The Small Sample Case: When n
&lt; 30</h2>
<p>Everything we’ve done so far assumes a <strong>large sample</strong>
(typically <span class="math inline">n \geq 30</span>). But what happens
when we have a small sample? The mathematics changes in an important
way.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-small-samples">The Problem with Small
Samples</h3>
<p>Consider the same problem, but now suppose we only have <span
class="math inline">n = 24</span> students in our sample. The sample
mean is still 83, and the sample standard deviation is still 10.1.</p>
<p>The key difference: when we use the sample standard deviation <span
class="math inline">s</span> to estimate the population standard
deviation <span class="math inline">\sigma</span>, we introduce
additional uncertainty. This uncertainty becomes problematic when the
sample size is small.</p>
<h3 id="william-gossets-t-distribution">William Gosset’s
T-Distribution</h3>
<p>In the early 1900s, William Sealy Gosset (writing under the pseudonym
“Student” because his employer, Guinness Brewery, didn’t allow employees
to publish) discovered that for small samples, the test statistic
doesn’t follow a normal distribution—it follows a
<strong>t-distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>The test statistic is still calculated the same way: <span
class="math display">
\zeta = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
</span></p>
<p>But now, instead of following a Z-distribution, ζ follows a
<strong>t-distribution with <span class="math inline">\nu = n-1</span>
degrees of freedom</strong>: <span class="math display">
\zeta \sim t_{\nu}
</span></p>
<section id="why-degrees-of-freedom" class="callout-important"
data-icon="false">
<h2>💡 Why Degrees of Freedom?</h2>
<p>We lose one degree of freedom because we used one piece of
information from our sample to estimate the population standard
deviation. We “expended” one observation to estimate the mean, which we
then used to calculate the standard deviation.</p>
<p>In our example with <span class="math inline">n = 24</span>, we have
<span class="math inline">\nu = 23</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="properties-of-the-t-distribution">Properties of the
T-Distribution</h3>
<p>The t-distribution looks similar to the normal distribution—it’s
symmetric and bell-shaped—but it has <strong>heavier tails</strong>.
This reflects the additional uncertainty from estimating the standard
deviation.</p>
<p>Key properties: 1. As the degrees of freedom increase, the
t-distribution approaches the normal distribution 2. For small degrees
of freedom, the tails are much heavier than the normal 3. By <span
class="math inline">\nu \approx 30</span>, the t-distribution is
virtually indistinguishable from the normal</p>
<h3 id="comparing-the-two-ratios">Comparing the Two Ratios</h3>
<p>Let’s clarify the distinction between two similar-looking ratios:</p>
<p><strong>Ratio A (with known σ):</strong> <span class="math display">
\text{Andrew} = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
</span></p>
<p><strong>Ratio B (with estimated s):</strong> <span
class="math display">
\text{Ben} = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}
</span></p>
<section id="question" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>🤔 Question</h2>
<p>Which ratio fluctuates more from sample to sample—Andrew or Ben?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ben fluctuates more because both the
numerator AND the denominator are random variables. In Andrew, only the
numerator (<span class="math inline">\bar{Y}</span>) varies; the
denominator (<span class="math inline">\sigma/\sqrt{n}</span>) is a
known constant. In Ben, both <span class="math inline">\bar{Y}</span>
and <span class="math inline">s</span> vary from sample to sample,
creating additional volatility.</p>
<p>This extra volatility is exactly what the t-distribution accounts
for.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="small-sample-analysis-our-example">Small Sample Analysis: Our

<p>Let’s return to our curriculum problem with the small sample of 24
students:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">n = 24</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\bar{y} = 83</span></li>

<p><span class="math display">

</span></p>
<p><strong>The Decision Changes</strong></p>
<p>Now our p-value (8%) exceeds our significance level (4%). We
<strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<section id="critical-insight" class="callout-warning"
data-icon="false">
<h2>⚠️ Critical Insight</h2>
<p>Notice what happened: With the same sample mean (83) and the same
sample standard deviation (10.1), we reached opposite conclusions
depending on our sample size!</p>
<ul>
<li>Large sample (<span class="math inline">n=38</span>): Reject <span

<li>Small sample (<span class="math inline">n=24</span>): Fail to reject
<span class="math inline">H_0</span> (p = 8%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference lies in the additional uncertainty from estimating σ
with a small sample. The t-distribution’s heavier tails mean we need
more extreme evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="when-to-use-each-distribution">When to Use Each
Distribution</h3>
<p><strong>Use the Z-distribution (normal) when:</strong> - Sample size
is large (<span class="math inline">n \geq 30</span>) - Population
standard deviation σ is known (rare in practice)</p>
<p><strong>Use the t-distribution when:</strong> - Sample size is small
(<span class="math inline">n &lt; 30</span>) - Population standard
deviation σ is unknown and must be estimated from the sample</p>
<p>In practice, many statisticians use the t-distribution for all tests
involving estimated standard deviations, regardless of sample size. As
the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution becomes virtually
identical to the normal, so using the t-distribution is a conservative
choice that’s always appropriate.</p>

<h2>🔄 The Theoretical Foundation</h2>
<p>Notice how our hypothesis testing framework rests on a foundation of
theoretical results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Markov’s Inequality</strong> → proves Chebyshev’s

<li><strong>Chebyshev’s Inequality</strong> → proves the Law of Large
Numbers</li>
<li><strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong> → proves the Central Limit

<li><strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong> → justifies the normality of
sampling distributions</li>
<li><strong>Unbiasedness</strong> → tells us where distributions are
centered</li>
<li><strong>Standard Error Formula</strong> → quantifies sampling
variability</li>

<p>Each piece plays a crucial role in the edifice we’ve constructed.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-two-sample-tests-and-causality">Looking Ahead:
Two-Sample Tests and Causality</h2>
<p>The hypothesis test we’ve developed compares a population mean to a
known constant (80). While this is valuable for understanding the
mechanics of hypothesis testing, it’s relatively rare in practice.</p>
<p>More commonly, we want to compare <strong>two groups</strong>: a
control group and a treatment group. This leads to two-sample tests,
which will be our next topic.</p>
<p>Two-sample tests look very similar mechanically to what we’ve done
here, with a crucial philosophical difference: they allow us to
investigate <strong>causality</strong>. By comparing a treatment group
to a control group, we can begin to assess whether an intervention has a
causal effect on an outcome.</p>
<p>The foundation you’ve built here—understanding sampling
distributions, standard errors, test statistics, and p-values—will carry
forward directly to these more powerful tests. The transition is a
relatively small mechanical extension, but it opens the door to
answering causal questions.</p>

<section id="question-1-understanding-standard-error"
class="callout-note" data-icon="false" data-collapse="true">
<h2>Question 1: Understanding Standard Error</h2>
<p>Suppose you have two samples from the same population: - Sample A:
<span class="math inline">n = 25</span>, <span class="math inline">s =
15</span> - Sample B: <span class="math inline">n = 100</span>, <span
class="math inline">s = 15</span></p>
<p>Which sample provides more precise estimates of the population mean?
Calculate the standard error for each and explain the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sample B provides more precise
estimates.</p>
<p>For Sample A: <span class="math inline">SE_A = 15/\sqrt{25} = 15/5 =
3</span></p>
<p>For Sample B: <span class="math inline">SE_B = 15/\sqrt{100} = 15/10
= 1.5</span></p>
<p>Sample B has a standard error half the size of Sample A, even though
they have the same sample standard deviation. The fourfold increase in
sample size (from 25 to 100) results in a twofold increase in precision
(standard error is halved). This demonstrates the principle that larger
samples yield more reliable estimates.</p>

<h2>Question 2: Interpreting Test Statistics</h2>
<p>A researcher calculates a test statistic of ζ = 2.5 for a large
sample test. Explain what this value means in plain language, and
describe where this value would fall on a standard normal
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A test statistic of ζ = 2.5 means that the
observed sample mean is 2.5 standard errors above the hypothesized
population mean under the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>On a standard normal distribution (bell curve), this value falls in
the right tail. Approximately 99.4% of the distribution lies to the left
of 2.5 standard deviations from the mean, so only about 0.6% lies beyond
this point. This suggests the observation would be quite unusual if the
null hypothesis were true.</p>
<p>For a one-sided test, the p-value would be approximately 0.006 or
0.6%, which would lead to rejection of the null at common significance
levels.</p>

<section id="question-3-large-vs.-small-sample-tests"
class="callout-note" data-icon="false" data-collapse="true">
<h2>Question 3: Large vs. Small Sample Tests</h2>
<p>You conduct the same hypothesis test twice: once with a sample size
of 100 and once with a sample size of 20. In both cases, you observe the
same sample mean and sample standard deviation.</p>
<p>Will the p-values be the same? Why or why not?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, the p-values will not be the same, and
the small sample will generally produce a larger p-value.</p>
<p>With <span class="math inline">n = 100</span>, we use the
Z-distribution (or t-distribution with 99 df, which is virtually
identical). The standard error will be relatively small: <span
class="math inline">SE = s/\sqrt{100} = s/10</span>.</p>
<p>With <span class="math inline">n = 20</span>, we must use the
t-distribution with 19 degrees of freedom, which has heavier tails than
the normal. Additionally, the standard error will be larger: <span
class="math inline">SE = s/\sqrt{20} \approx s/4.47</span>.</p>
<p>Two effects compound: 1. The larger standard error makes the test
statistic smaller 2. The t-distribution with few degrees of freedom
makes any given test statistic less significant</p>
<p>Both effects work against rejecting the null hypothesis, resulting in
a larger p-value for the small sample test.</p>

<section id="question-4-choosing-significance-levels"
class="callout-note" data-icon="false" data-collapse="true">
<h2>Question 4: Choosing Significance Levels</h2>
<p>Explain why a researcher might choose a more stringent significance
level (say, α = 0.01) rather than a more lenient one (say, α = 0.10).
What are the tradeoffs involved?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The choice of significance level involves a
tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors:</p>
<p><strong>Choosing a more stringent α (like 0.01):</strong> -
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Lower risk of Type I error (falsely rejecting
a true null hypothesis) - <strong>Cost:</strong> Higher risk of Type II
error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) - <strong>When
appropriate:</strong> When the cost of a false positive is high (e.g.,
approving an unsafe drug, implementing an expensive program that doesn’t
work)</p>
<p><strong>Choosing a more lenient α (like 0.10):</strong> -
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Lower risk of Type II error (more power to
detect real effects) - <strong>Cost:</strong> Higher risk of Type I
error - <strong>When appropriate:</strong> When we want to detect
potentially important effects for further investigation, or when the
cost of a false negative is high</p>
<p>In fields where the consequences of a Type I error are severe (like
medical research or engineering safety), researchers typically use
stricter significance levels. In exploratory research or preliminary
studies, more lenient levels might be acceptable.</p>
