<h1 id="multiple-regression">Multiple Regression</h1>
<p>In 1978, David Harrison and Daniel Rubinfeld published a
groundbreaking study on housing values and air pollution in the Boston
metropolitan area. Their work introduced what has become one of the most
studied datasets in econometrics and demonstrated how hedonic pricing
models can be used to value environmental amenities—specifically, how
air quality afects property values.</p>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld model remains a cornerstone example in applied
econometrics courses because it elegantly combines theory with empirical
analysis, using a rich set of neighborhood characteristics to explain
median home values across census tracts in the Boston area.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<p>What is a hedonic pricing model, and why is it useful for valuing
environmental goods?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer" class="callout-tip" data-icon="false"
data-collapse="true">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>A hedonic pricing model decomposes the price of a good into the value
of its constituent characteristics. For housing, this means breaking
down the home price into components attributable to structural features
(number of rooms, age), neighborhood characteristics (crime rate, school
quality), and environmental amenities (air quality, proximity to
employment centers).</p>
<p>This approach is particularly valuable for environmental economics
because many environmental goods—like clean air—don’t have explicit
market prices. By observing how home values change with air quality
while controlling for other factors, we can infer people’s willingness
to pay for cleaner air. This is crucial for cost-benefit analysis of
environmental regulations.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-specification">The Model Specification</h2>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld model estimates the logarithm of median home
value as a function of 13 explanatory variables:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
\log(   \text{MEDV}) = \beta_0 &amp;+ \beta_1   \text{ NOX}^2 +

<p>Before interpreting the coefficients, let’s understand what each
variable represents and why certain functional forms were chosen.</p>
<h2 id="the-variables-and-their-transformations">The Variables and Their
Transformations</h2>
<section id="definition" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>NOX (Nitric Oxide Concentration)</strong>: Annual average
concentration of nitric oxides in parts per 10 million, measured at the
census tract level. This is the key environmental variable in the
study.</p>
</section>
<p>The model includes <strong>NOX²</strong> rather than NOX itself. This
quadratic specification allows for a nonlinear relationship between air
pollution and housing values—suggesting that the marginal effect of
pollution may increase at higher pollution levels.</p>
<section id="question-1" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Why might the relationship between pollution and home values be
nonlinear?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-1" class="callout-tip" data-icon="false"
data-collapse="true">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>There are several economic reasons to expect nonlinearity. First, at
very low pollution levels, small increases may have minimal health
impacts and thus little effect on property values. But at higher levels,
additional pollution could have increasingly severe health consequences,
making marginal increases more harmful.</p>
<p>Second, there may be threshold effects—once pollution reaches certain
levels, it becomes visibly obvious (as smog) or causes noticeable health
effects, triggering a sharper decline in willingness to pay for homes in
that area.</p>
<p>Third, people who are highly sensitive to pollution likely already
avoid high-pollution areas, so the remaining residents may be those who
are relatively less concerned about pollution, leading to smaller
marginal price effects at higher pollution levels. However, this
selection effect would actually suggest the opposite of what Harrison
and Rubinfeld found.</p>
</section>
<section id="definition-1" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>RM (Average Number of Rooms)</strong>: The average number of
rooms per dwelling in the census tract. This is a proxy for house size
and quality.</p>
</section>
<p>The model includes <strong>RM²</strong> to capture potential
nonlinear effects of house size. Larger homes may command
disproportionately higher prices, or there may be diminishing returns to
additional rooms.</p>
<section id="definition-2" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>AGE (Proportion of Old Units)</strong>: The proportion of
owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. This captures the age
composition of the housing stock.</p>
</section>
<section id="definition-3" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>B (Proportion Black)</strong>: A transformation of the
proportion of Black residents, specifically <span
class="math inline">(1000(B_k - 0.63)^2)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">B_k</span> is the proportion of the population that
is Black. The model includes <strong>(B - 0.63)²</strong>.</p>
</section>
<p>This is perhaps the most controversial variable in the model. The
quadratic form centered at 0.63 suggests that home values are maximized
when the proportion of Black residents is 63%, declining as the
proportion moves away from this value in either direction.</p>
<section id="question-2" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>What does the racial composition variable tell us about housing
markets in 1970s Boston?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2" class="callout-tip" data-icon="false"
data-collapse="true">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The inclusion and specification of this variable reflect the
unfortunate reality of racial segregation and discrimination in housing
markets during this period. The quadratic form centered at 0.63 could be
interpreted in different ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tipping point dynamics</strong>: Housing economics
literature has documented “tipping points” in neighborhood racial
composition, where rapid demographic change leads to accelerated White
flight and declining property values. The centered quadratic could
capture these dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preference heterogeneity</strong>: Different demographic
groups may have different preferences regarding neighborhood racial
composition, and the quadratic form could reflect these varying
preferences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical discrimination</strong>: The pattern likely
reflects discriminatory practices including redlining, steering by real
estate agents, and discriminatory lending practices that were widespread
before the Fair Housing Act of 1968.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern researchers often exclude or carefully respecify racial
composition variables, as their interpretation requires careful
attention to whether they reflect preferences, discrimination, or
correlated socioeconomic factors.</p>

<section id="definition-4" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>LSTAT (Lower Status Population)</strong>: The percentage of
the population considered “lower status” (defined by education and
occupation). The model includes <strong>log(LSTAT)</strong>.</p>
</section>
<p>The logarithmic transformation suggests that percentage point changes
in lower-status population have diminishing effects—going from 5% to 10%
has a larger impact than going from 25% to 30%.</p>
<section id="definition-5" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>CRIM (Crime Rate)</strong>: Per capita crime rate by town.
Measured as incidents per capita.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>ZN (Large Residential Lots)</strong>: The proportion of
residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet. This captures
whether the area has large-lot zoning, typically associated with more
expensive neighborhoods.</p>

<p><strong>INDUS (Industrial Land)</strong>: The proportion of
non-retail business acres per town. This measures the industrial
character of the area.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>TAX (Property Tax Rate)</strong>: The full-value property tax
rate per $10,000 of assessed value.</p>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="callout-note" data-icon="false">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>Why might property tax rates affect home values even though buyers
will pay these taxes anyway?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-3" class="callout-tip" data-icon="false"
data-collapse="true">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>Property taxes affect home values through several channels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Capitalization</strong>: Higher taxes reduce the present
value of owning the home, which gets capitalized into lower purchase
prices. Buyers are willing to pay less upfront if they face higher
ongoing costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public services</strong>: Property taxes fund local
services like schools, police, and infrastructure. If high taxes reflect
good services, they might increase values. If they reflect inefficient
government, they decrease values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tax competition</strong>: In metropolitan areas with many
municipalities, people can “vote with their feet,” choosing towns with
favorable tax-service packages. This leads to stratification by
preferences and income.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The model doesn’t directly account for the services financed by these
taxes, so the coefficient primarily captures the capitalization
effect.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>PTRATIO (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)</strong>: The pupil-teacher
ratio by town. Lower ratios indicate smaller class sizes, typically
associated with better schools.</p>

<section id="definition-10" class="callout-important" data-icon="false">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>CHAS (Charles River Dummy)</strong>: A binary variable equal
to 1 if the census tract borders the Charles River, 0 otherwise. This
captures the amenity value of water proximity.</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p><strong>DIS (Distance to Employment)</strong>: Weighted distance to
five Boston employment centers. The model includes
<strong>log(DIS)</strong>.</p>
</section>
<p>The logarithmic transformation implies that distance has diminishing
effects—being 1 mile from employment centers versus 2 miles matters more
than being 10 miles versus 11 miles.</p>
