<h1 id="multiple-regression">Multiple Regression</h1>
<p>In 1978, David Harrison and Daniel Rubinfeld published a
groundbreaking study on housing values and air pollution in the Boston
metropolitan area. Their work introduced what has become one of the most
studied datasets in econometrics and demonstrated how hedonic pricing
models can be used to value environmental amenities—specifically, how
air quality affects property values.</p>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld model remains a cornerstone example in applied
econometrics courses because it elegantly combines theory with empirical
analysis, using a rich set of neighborhood characteristics to explain
median home values across census tracts in the Boston area.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>What is a hedonic pricing model, and why is it useful for valuing
environmental goods?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>A hedonic pricing model decomposes the price of a good into the value
of its constituent characteristics. For housing, this means breaking
down the home price into components attributable to structural features
(number of rooms, age), neighborhood characteristics (crime rate, school
quality), and environmental amenities (air quality, proximity to
employment centers).</p>
<p>This approach is particularly valuable for environmental economics
because many environmental goods—like clean air—don’t have explicit
market prices. By observing how home values change with air quality
while controlling for other factors, we can infer people’s willingness
to pay for cleaner air. This is crucial for cost-benefit analysis of
environmental regulations.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-model-specification">The Model Specification</h2>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld model estimates the logarithm of median home
value as a function of 13 explanatory variables:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{MEDV}) = \beta_0 &amp;+ \beta_1 \text{ NOX}^2 + \beta_2
\text{ RM}^2 + \beta_3 \text{ AGE} + \beta_4 (\text{B} - 0.63)^2 \\
&amp;+ \beta_5 \log(\text{LSTAT}) + \beta_6 \text{ CRIM} + \beta_7
\text{ ZN} + \beta_8 \text{ INDUS} \\
&amp;+ \beta_9 \text{ TAX} + \beta_{10} \text{ PTRATIO} + \beta_{11}
\text{ CHAS} \\
&amp;+ \beta_{12} \log(\text{DIS}) + \beta_{13} \log(\text{RAD}) +
\epsilon
\end{aligned}
</span></p>
<p>Before interpreting the coefficients, let’s understand what each
variable represents and why certain functional forms were chosen.</p>
<h2 id="the-variables-and-their-transformations">The Variables and Their
Transformations</h2>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>NOX (Nitric Oxide Concentration)</strong>: Annual average
concentration of nitric oxides in parts per 10 million, measured at the
census tract level. This is the key environmental variable in the
study.</p>
</div>
<p>The model includes <strong>NOX²</strong> rather than NOX itself. This
quadratic specification allows for a nonlinear relationship between air
pollution and housing values—suggesting that the marginal effect of
pollution may increase at higher pollution levels.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Why might the relationship between pollution and home values be
nonlinear?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are several economic reasons to expect nonlinearity. First, at
very low pollution levels, small increases may have minimal health
impacts and thus little effect on property values. But at higher levels,
additional pollution could have increasingly severe health consequences,
making marginal increases more harmful.</p>
<p>Second, there may be threshold effects—once pollution reaches certain
levels, it becomes visibly obvious (as smog) or causes noticeable health
effects, triggering a sharper decline in willingness to pay for homes in
that area.</p>
<p>Third, people who are highly sensitive to pollution likely already
avoid high-pollution areas, so the remaining residents may be those who
are relatively less concerned about pollution, leading to smaller
marginal price effects at higher pollution levels. However, this
selection effect would actually suggest the opposite of what Harrison
and Rubinfeld found.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>RM (Average Number of Rooms)</strong>: The average number of
rooms per dwelling in the census tract. This is a proxy for house size
and quality.</p>
</div>
<p>The model includes <strong>RM²</strong> to capture potential
nonlinear effects of house size. Larger homes may command
disproportionately higher prices, or there may be diminishing returns to
additional rooms.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>AGE (Proportion of Old Units)</strong>: The proportion of
owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. This captures the age
composition of the housing stock.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>B (Proportion Black)</strong>: A transformation of the
proportion of Black residents, specifically <span
class="math inline">(1000(B_k - 0.63)^2)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">B_k</span> is the proportion of the population that
is Black. The model includes <strong>(B - 0.63)²</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is perhaps the most controversial variable in the model. The
quadratic form centered at 0.63 suggests that home values are maximized
when the proportion of Black residents is 63%, declining as the
proportion moves away from this value in either direction.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>What does the racial composition variable tell us about housing
markets in 1970s Boston?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The inclusion and specification of this variable reflect the
unfortunate reality of racial segregation and discrimination in housing
markets during this period. The quadratic form centered at 0.63 could be
interpreted in different ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tipping point dynamics</strong>: Housing economics
literature has documented “tipping points” in neighborhood racial
composition, where rapid demographic change leads to accelerated White
flight and declining property values. The centered quadratic could
capture these dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preference heterogeneity</strong>: Different demographic
groups may have different preferences regarding neighborhood racial
composition, and the quadratic form could reflect these varying
preferences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical discrimination</strong>: The pattern likely
reflects discriminatory practices including redlining, steering by real
estate agents, and discriminatory lending practices that were widespread
before the Fair Housing Act of 1968.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern researchers often exclude or carefully respecify racial
composition variables, as their interpretation requires careful
attention to whether they reflect preferences, discrimination, or
correlated socioeconomic factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>LSTAT (Lower Status Population)</strong>: The percentage of
the population considered “lower status” (defined by education and
occupation). The model includes <strong>log(LSTAT)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The logarithmic transformation suggests that percentage point changes
in lower-status population have diminishing effects—going from 5% to 10%
has a larger impact than going from 25% to 30%.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>CRIM (Crime Rate)</strong>: Per capita crime rate by town.
Measured as incidents per capita.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>ZN (Large Residential Lots)</strong>: The proportion of
residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet. This captures
whether the area has large-lot zoning, typically associated with more
expensive neighborhoods.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>INDUS (Industrial Land)</strong>: The proportion of
non-retail business acres per town. This measures the industrial
character of the area.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>TAX (Property Tax Rate)</strong>: The full-value property tax
rate per $10,000 of assessed value.</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>Why might property tax rates affect home values even though buyers
will pay these taxes anyway?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Property taxes affect home values through several channels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Capitalization</strong>: Higher taxes reduce the present
value of owning the home, which gets capitalized into lower purchase
prices. Buyers are willing to pay less upfront if they face higher
ongoing costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public services</strong>: Property taxes fund local
services like schools, police, and infrastructure. If high taxes reflect
good services, they might increase values. If they reflect inefficient
government, they decrease values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tax competition</strong>: In metropolitan areas with many
municipalities, people can “vote with their feet,” choosing towns with
favorable tax-service packages. This leads to stratification by
preferences and income.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The model doesn’t directly account for the services financed by these
taxes, so the coefficient primarily captures the capitalization
effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>PTRATIO (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)</strong>: The pupil-teacher
ratio by town. Lower ratios indicate smaller class sizes, typically
associated with better schools.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>CHAS (Charles River Dummy)</strong>: A binary variable equal
to 1 if the census tract borders the Charles River, 0 otherwise. This
captures the amenity value of water proximity.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>DIS (Distance to Employment)</strong>: Weighted distance to
five Boston employment centers. The model includes
<strong>log(DIS)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The logarithmic transformation implies that distance has diminishing
effects—being 1 mile from employment centers versus 2 miles matters more
than being 10 miles versus 11 miles.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>RAD (Highway Accessibility)</strong>: An index of
accessibility to radial highways. The model includes
<strong>log(RAD)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-coefficients">Interpreting the
Coefficients</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the variables, let’s interpret what each
coefficient tells us. The dependent variable is log(MEDV), which means
we need to be careful about the interpretation depending on whether the
independent variable is in levels, logs, or transformed.</p>
<h3 id="environmental-quality-beta_1-nox²">Environmental Quality: <span
class="math inline">\beta_1</span> (NOX²)</h3>
<p>Since the model includes NOX², the effect of pollution on home values
is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial \text{NOX}} = 2\beta_1 \cdot
\text{NOX}
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_1 &lt; 0</span> (which Harrison
and Rubinfeld found), then higher pollution reduces home values, and
this effect intensifies at higher pollution levels.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_1 = -0.008</span> and the mean NOX
level is 0.55, what does this tell us about the effect of pollution?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>At the mean pollution level, the marginal effect is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial \text{NOX}} = 2(-0.008)(0.55)
= -0.0088
</span></p>
<p>This means a one-unit increase in NOX (from 0.55 to 1.55 parts per 10
million) would decrease log(MEDV) by 0.0088, which corresponds to
approximately a 0.88% decrease in median home value.</p>
<p>However, this interpretation requires careful thought about units. A
one-unit change in NOX is actually quite large given the scale of the
variable. A more realistic interpretation considers smaller changes—say,
a 0.1 unit increase in NOX:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\Delta \log(\text{MEDV}) \approx 2(-0.008)(0.55)(0.1) = -0.00088
</span></p>
<p>This suggests a 0.1 unit increase in NOX is associated with about a
0.09% decrease in home values.</p>
</div>
<p>The key insight from this coefficient is that air quality has a
measurable, statistically significant effect on property
values—providing evidence that people value clean air and are willing to
pay for it through higher home prices.</p>
<h3 id="housing-stock-beta_2-rm²-and-beta_3-age">Housing Stock: <span
class="math inline">\beta_2</span> (RM²) and <span
class="math inline">\beta_3</span> (AGE)</h3>
<p>The coefficient on RM² captures how house size affects values:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial \text{RM}} = 2\beta_2 \cdot
\text{RM}
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_2 &gt; 0</span>, larger homes
command higher prices, with the effect strengthening for larger homes.
This makes economic sense: going from a 4-room to a 5-room dwelling
might add 25% more space, but going from 8 rooms to 9 rooms adds only
12.5% more space, yet the marginal value might be similar in both cases,
implying larger percentage increases for bigger homes.</p>
<p>For AGE, the coefficient <span class="math inline">\beta_3</span>
indicates how the proportion of older housing stock affects values. If
<span class="math inline">\beta_3 &lt; 0</span>, areas with older
housing have lower median values. This could reflect: - Physical
depreciation of older structures - Obsolete layouts or designs - Higher
maintenance costs</p>
<p>However, in some markets, older housing might be valued for
architectural character or historical significance, potentially yielding
<span class="math inline">\beta_3 &gt; 0</span>.</p>
<h3 id="demographics-beta_4-b---0.63²-and-beta_5-loglstat">Demographics:
<span class="math inline">\beta_4</span> ((B - 0.63)²) and <span
class="math inline">\beta_5</span> (log(LSTAT))</h3>
<p>The coefficient on (B - 0.63)² tells us how racial composition
affects values. If <span class="math inline">\beta_4 &lt; 0</span>, home
values decline as the proportion of Black residents moves away from 63%
in either direction. The marginal effect is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial B} = 2\beta_4(B - 0.63)
</span></p>
<p>This means: - When B &lt; 0.63: The derivative is negative if <span
class="math inline">\beta_4 &lt; 0</span>, so decreasing B (more
segregation) reduces values - When B &gt; 0.63: The derivative is
positive if <span class="math inline">\beta_4 &lt; 0</span>, so
increasing B reduces values - When B = 0.63: The derivative is zero,
representing a local maximum</p>
<p>For LSTAT, since we have log(LSTAT) on the right side and log(MEDV)
on the left:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\beta_5 = \frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial \log(\text{LSTAT})}
= \frac{\%\Delta \text{MEDV}}{\%\Delta \text{LSTAT}}
</span></p>
<p>This is an elasticity. If <span class="math inline">\beta_5 =
-0.4</span>, then a 1% increase in the lower-status population is
associated with a 0.4% decrease in median home values. This captures
socioeconomic stratification across neighborhoods.</p>
<h3 id="crime-and-safety-beta_6-crim">Crime and Safety: <span
class="math inline">\beta_6</span> (CRIM)</h3>
<p>Since CRIM enters in levels (not logged), while MEDV is logged:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\beta_6 = \frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial \text{CRIM}}
\approx \frac{\%\Delta \text{MEDV}}{\Delta \text{CRIM}}
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_6 = -0.02</span>, then a one-unit
increase in the per capita crime rate (say, from 5 to 6 incidents per
capita) is associated with approximately a 2% decrease in home values.
This quantifies the safety premium in housing markets.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Why might the crime effect on home values differ from the direct
costs of crime victimization?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The home value effect captures not just the direct expected costs of
victimization (which might be small for any individual household), but
also:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Risk aversion</strong>: People are willing to pay
premiums to avoid even small risks of victimization, especially violent
crime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality of life</strong>: High crime areas may have other
undesirable features correlated with crime (noise, disorder, vandalism)
that directly reduce neighborhood quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peer effects</strong>: Crime rates may signal the type of
neighbors one would have, affecting social capital and community
cohesion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endogeneity concerns</strong>: Crime might be correlated
with omitted variables like school quality or local government
effectiveness, so the coefficient may capture more than just crime per
se.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The hedonic coefficient thus represents the total willingness to pay
for safety and associated neighborhood characteristics, not just the
expected loss from crime.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="zoning-and-land-use-beta_7-zn-and-beta_8-indus">Zoning and Land
Use: <span class="math inline">\beta_7</span> (ZN) and <span
class="math inline">\beta_8</span> (INDUS)</h3>
<p>For ZN (large-lot zoning), if <span class="math inline">\beta_7 &gt;
0</span>, then areas with more large-lot zoning have higher home values.
This could reflect: - Exclusionary zoning that maintains low density and
high values - Preferences for space and privacy - Correlation with
higher-income neighborhoods</p>
<p>For INDUS, if <span class="math inline">\beta_8 &lt; 0</span>, then
areas with more industrial land have lower residential values. This
makes intuitive sense: industrial activity may generate noise,
pollution, traffic, and aesthetic disamenities that reduce the
desirability of nearby housing.</p>
<h3 id="fiscal-variables-beta_9-tax-and-beta_10-ptratio">Fiscal
Variables: <span class="math inline">\beta_9</span> (TAX) and <span
class="math inline">\beta_{10}</span> (PTRATIO)</h3>
<p>The property tax coefficient <span class="math inline">\beta_9</span>
captures the capitalization of taxes into home values. If <span
class="math inline">\beta_9 &lt; 0</span>, higher tax rates reduce home
values, suggesting that the capitalization effect dominates any positive
effect from better services.</p>
<p>The pupil-teacher ratio coefficient <span
class="math inline">\beta_{10}</span> tells us about school quality
effects. If <span class="math inline">\beta_{10} &lt; 0</span>, higher
pupil-teacher ratios (worse schools) reduce home values. This is
evidence that school quality is capitalized into housing prices—a key
finding in public finance.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>The model includes both TAX and PTRATIO. What does this tell us about
the relationship between taxes and school quality?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Including both variables allows us to separately identify: 1. The
effect of taxes holding school quality constant (captured by <span
class="math inline">\beta_9</span>) 2. The effect of school quality
holding taxes constant (captured by <span
class="math inline">\beta_{10}</span>)</p>
<p>If people valued taxes and school quality purely as a “tax-service
package,” we might expect these effects to offset: higher taxes would be
acceptable if they bought better schools. But by including both, we can
see whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>High taxes with poor schools (high PTRATIO) lead to especially low
values</li>
<li>Good schools (low PTRATIO) can partially compensate for high
taxes</li>
<li>Taxes and school quality are independently capitalized</li>
</ul>
<p>The separate inclusion suggests that residents care about both the
level of public services AND the tax price they pay for them, consistent
with models of local public finance where efficient jurisdictions (good
services, lower taxes) command premiums.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="amenities-beta_11-chas">Amenities: <span
class="math inline">\beta_{11}</span> (CHAS)</h3>
<p>The Charles River dummy coefficient <span
class="math inline">\beta_{11}</span> captures the premium for water
proximity. Since CHAS is a dummy variable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\beta_{11} = \mathbb{E}[\log(\text{MEDV}) | \text{CHAS}=1] -
\mathbb{E}[\log(\text{MEDV}) | \text{CHAS}=0]
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_{11} = 0.08</span>, then census
tracts bordering the Charles River have median home values approximately
8.3% higher than comparable tracts not bordering the river (using the
exact formula: <span class="math inline">e^{0.08} - 1 \approx
0.083</span>).</p>
<p>This demonstrates the capitalization of environmental amenities into
property values and is one of many ways economists can estimate
willingness to pay for environmental goods.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility-beta_12-logdis-and-beta_13-lograd">Accessibility:
<span class="math inline">\beta_{12}</span> (log(DIS)) and <span
class="math inline">\beta_{13}</span> (log(RAD))</h3>
<p>For distance to employment centers, since both sides are logged:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\beta_{12} = \frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial
\log(\text{DIS})} = \frac{\%\Delta \text{MEDV}}{\%\Delta \text{DIS}}
</span></p>
<p>This is an elasticity. If <span class="math inline">\beta_{12} =
-0.15</span>, then a 1% increase in distance to employment centers is
associated with a 0.15% decrease in home values. The negative
coefficient reflects the commuting cost premium—people pay more to live
closer to jobs.</p>
<p>Similarly, for highway accessibility:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\beta_{13} = \frac{\partial \log(\text{MEDV})}{\partial
\log(\text{RAD})}
</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\beta_{13} = 0.10</span>, then a 1%
increase in highway accessibility is associated with a 0.10% increase in
home values. Better highway access reduces commuting time and connects
residents to amenities, increasing the area’s desirability.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Could highway accessibility have a negative effect on home values?
Under what circumstances?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Yes, highway accessibility could theoretically have negative
effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Noise and pollution</strong>: Being very close to
highways generates noise pollution and air pollution from traffic, which
could reduce values despite improved accessibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barrier effects</strong>: Highways can divide
neighborhoods and create pedestrian barriers, reducing walkability and
community cohesion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aesthetic disamenities</strong>: The visual presence of
elevated highways or large interchanges can be unappealing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The sign and magnitude of the highway accessibility coefficient
likely depends on the measurement: an index of network accessibility
(how well-connected the area is) would likely have positive effects,
while distance to the nearest highway might have ambiguous effects—some
proximity is good (accessibility) but too close is bad (noise).</p>
<p>In the Harrison-Rubinfeld model, RAD measures accessibility as an
index, so it likely captures the network connectivity benefits rather
than the disamenities of being immediately adjacent to a highway.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-intercept-beta_0">The Intercept: <span
class="math inline">\beta_0</span></h2>
<p>The intercept <span class="math inline">\beta_0</span> represents the
predicted log median home value when all explanatory variables are zero.
This has no meaningful interpretation in this context because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Many variables can’t actually be zero (like RM—houses need at least
some rooms)</li>
<li>The model includes squared and logged terms that make zero points
artificial</li>
<li>No census tract in the data has all variables at zero</li>
</ol>
<p>The intercept’s role is to shift the entire prediction function to
match the observed range of home values given the actual distribution of
the explanatory variables. It’s a necessary component for accurate
predictions but doesn’t have a substantive economic interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="the-error-term-epsilon">The Error Term: <span
class="math inline">\epsilon</span></h2>
<p>The error term captures all determinants of home values not included
in the model: - Idiosyncratic features of specific properties -
Measurement error in the variables - Omitted neighborhood
characteristics - Unobservable location amenities - Time-specific
shocks</p>
<p>The key assumption for causal interpretation is that <span
class="math inline">\mathbb{E}[\epsilon | X] = 0</span>—the error term
is uncorrelated with the included explanatory variables. This requires
that all confounding factors are either included in the model or are
uncorrelated with both home values and the variables of interest.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>What are the main threats to the identification assumption in the
Harrison-Rubinfeld model?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Several potential violations could bias the coefficients:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Omitted variables</strong>: Any characteristic that
affects both home values and is correlated with included variables will
bias estimates. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>School quality measures beyond PTRATIO</li>
<li>Crime type (violent vs. property)</li>
<li>Local amenities (parks, restaurants, retail)</li>
<li>Housing unit quality within tracts</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reverse causality</strong>: Some variables might be
endogenous. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>High home values might attract more property tax revenue,
potentially affecting TAX</li>
<li>Expensive neighborhoods might invest more in crime prevention,
affecting CRIM</li>
<li>Demand for housing might influence zoning decisions (ZN)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Measurement error</strong>: Variables are measured at the
census tract level but ideally would be property-specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all houses in a tract face the same crime risk</li>
<li>Distance to employment varies within tracts</li>
<li>Air quality can have micro-scale variation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample selection</strong>: The data covers only the
Boston metropolitan area in 1970. Results may not generalize to other
cities, time periods, or housing markets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spatial correlation</strong>: Nearby census tracts likely
have correlated unobservables, violating the assumption of independent
errors and potentially biasing standard errors even if point estimates
are unbiased.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern applications often address these concerns through instrumental
variables, spatial econometric methods, or quasi-experimental designs
exploiting policy changes or other sources of exogenous variation.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="synthesizing-the-results">Synthesizing the Results</h2>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld model demonstrates how hedonic pricing methods
can decompose property values into their constituent parts. Each
coefficient tells us how much people are willing to pay—through higher
home prices—for marginal improvements in that characteristic.</p>
<p>Key insights from the coefficient interpretations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Environmental quality is valued</strong>: The negative
coefficient on NOX² shows that air pollution reduces property values,
providing a revealed-preference measure of willingness to pay for clean
air.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neighborhood socioeconomics matter</strong>: The
coefficients on LSTAT and the racial composition variable show strong
effects of neighborhood demographics, reflecting either preferences or
the correlation of these variables with unobserved neighborhood
quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety commands a premium</strong>: The negative
coefficient on CRIM quantifies how much people pay to live in safer
neighborhoods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local public finance is capitalized</strong>: Both
property taxes and school quality (PTRATIO) significantly affect home
values, consistent with theories of fiscal capitalization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Location and accessibility matter</strong>: The distance
to employment centers and highway accessibility coefficients show the
value of reduced commuting costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Natural amenities are priced</strong>: The Charles River
dummy shows that even simple geographical features command measurable
premiums.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these interpretations is crucial not just for applied
econometrics, but for policy analysis. When regulators conduct
cost-benefit analysis of environmental regulations, hedonic pricing
studies like Harrison and Rubinfeld’s provide the benefit estimates.
When local governments make zoning decisions or invest in public
services, understanding how these choices are capitalized into property
values helps predict impacts on community composition and tax
revenues.</p>
<h2 id="technical-notes-on-functional-form">Technical Notes on

choices that affect interpretation:</p>

<p><strong>Quadratic terms</strong>: When a variable appears squared,
its effect is nonlinear, and the marginal effect depends on the level of
the variable.</p>

<p>The choice among these functional forms should ideally be guided by
economic theory and tested using the data. Harrison and Rubinfeld likely
experimented with various specifications, choosing functional forms
that: 1. Fit the data well (high R², low residual variance) 2. Made
economic sense (appropriate signs, reasonable magnitudes) 3. Satisfied
statistical diagnostics (no heteroskedasticity, normality of
residuals)</p>
<p>Modern practice often uses more flexible functional forms (splines,
polynomials, or nonparametric methods) or machine learning approaches
that let the data reveal the functional relationships without imposing
strong restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Harrison-Rubinfeld hedonic pricing model exemplifies how careful
empirical analysis can reveal the implicit prices of characteristics
that don’t trade in explicit markets. By interpreting each coefficient
correctly—accounting for functional form, units, and identification
assumptions—we transform a regression equation into a rich description
of how various neighborhood and housing characteristics are valued in
the housing market.</p>
<p>These interpretations matter for: - <strong>Policy makers</strong>
evaluating the benefits of environmental regulations - <strong>Urban
planners</strong> understanding the trade-offs residents make regarding
location, density, and amenities - <strong>Economists</strong> studying
how households sort across neighborhoods and how local public goods are
valued - <strong>Real estate professionals</strong> predicting how
property values respond to changes in neighborhood characteristics</p>
<p>The model’s enduring influence in economics stems not just from its
methodological contributions, but from its demonstration that even
complex, multifaceted goods like housing can be decomposed and
understood through careful economic analysis—revealing the preferences
and values that lie beneath market prices.</p>
