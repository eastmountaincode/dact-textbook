<h1 id="probability">Probability</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll introduce some fundamental concepts in
probability theory. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to
define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample space</li>
<li>Outcome</li>
<li>Event</li>
<li>Probability</li>
<li>Random variable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-probability">What is probability?</h2>
<div class="question">
<p>What is probability?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Probability is a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty.
It assigns numerical values between 0 and 1 to events, where 0 indicates
impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-note" title="Important Definition">
<p>The <strong>sample space</strong> is the set of all possible outcomes
of an experiment. For a coin flip, the sample space is <span
class="math inline">\{H, T\}</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example. Imagine you’re flipping a fair coin.
The sample space consists of two possible outcomes: heads (H) and tails
(T).</p>
<p>The probability of getting heads is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable
outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{1}{2} =
0.5</span></p>
<h2 id="random-variables">Random Variables</h2>
<p>A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the
outcomes of a random experiment.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Can you give an example of a random variable?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Consider rolling a six-sided die. Let <span
class="math inline">X</span> be the random variable representing the
number that appears on the top face. Then <span
class="math inline">X</span> can take values <span
class="math inline">\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</span>, each with probability
<span class="math inline">1/6</span> if the die is fair.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="relationship-between-pdfs-and-cdfs">Relationship between PDFs
and CDFs</h2>
<p>The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution
function (CDF) are two fundamental ways of describing a probability
distribution. The interactive visualization below demonstrates how these
functions relate to each other.</p>
<p>Use the dropdown menu to explore different distributions (Normal,
Lognormal, and Uniform), and drag the slider to see how the PDF height
at a point relates to the CDF value at that same point.</p>

</iframe>
<p>As you move the slider, observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDF (<em>f(Y)</em>) shows the <strong>height</strong> of the
density at any given value</li>
<li>The CDF (<em>F(Y)</em>) shows the <strong>area under the PDF
curve</strong> to the left of that value</li>
<li>The shaded region in the PDF panel corresponds exactly to the CDF
value</li>
</ul>
