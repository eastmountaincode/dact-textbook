# Probability


In this chapter, we'll introduce some fundamental concepts in probability theory. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to define the following:

- Sample space
- Outcome
- Event
- Probability
- Random variable

## What is probability?

::: {.question}
What is probability?
:::

::: {.answer}
Probability is a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty. It assigns numerical values between 0 and 1 to events, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

::: {.callout-note title="Important Definition"}
The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a coin flip, the sample space is $\{H, T\}$.
:::

Let's consider a simple example. Imagine you're flipping a fair coin. The sample space consists of two possible outcomes: heads (H) and tails (T).

The probability of getting heads is:

$$P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$

## Random Variables

A random variable is a function that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment.

::: {.question}
Can you give an example of a random variable?
:::

::: {.answer}
Consider rolling a six-sided die. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number that appears on the top face. Then $X$ can take values $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, each with probability $1/6$ if the die is fair.

## Relationship between PDFs and CDFs

The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are two fundamental ways of describing a probability distribution. The interactive visualization below demonstrates how these functions relate to each other.

Use the dropdown menu to explore different distributions (Normal, Lognormal, and Uniform), and drag the slider to see how the PDF height at a point relates to the CDF value at that same point.

As you move the slider, observe that:

- The PDF (*f(Y)*) shows the **height** of the density at any given value
- The CDF (*F(Y)*) shows the **area under the PDF curve** to the left of that value
- The shaded region in the PDF panel corresponds exactly to the CDF value
