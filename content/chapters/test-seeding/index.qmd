# Test Chapter for Seeding

This is a test chapter to verify that the chapter seeding process works correctly during deployment.

If you can see this chapter in the sidebar and read this content, the seeding process is working as expected.

## What This Tests

1. The `chapters.yaml` file is being read correctly
2. The QMD file is being built to HTML
3. The `seed-chapters` script is running during build
4. The chapter is being upserted to the Supabase database

You can delete this chapter after confirming everything works.
