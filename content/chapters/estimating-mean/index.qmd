# Estimating the population mean


In this chapter, we'll explore three fundamental properties of statistical estimators that form the backbone of statistical inference. We'll prove that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean, demonstrate that it's the most efficient among all unbiased estimators, and examine why the sample variance requires a correction factor. These proofs are not merely mathematical exercises—they reveal deep truths about how we can reliably learn about populations from samples.

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- What makes an estimator "unbiased" and why this matters
- How to compare estimators using the criterion of efficiency
- Why the sample variance formula uses $n-1$ instead of $n$
- The relationship between sample statistics and population parameters

## The Unbiasedness of the Sample Mean

Let's begin with a fundamental question that underlies all of statistical inference.

## Question

How do we know that the sample mean is a reliable estimator of the population mean? Could there be systematic error in our estimates?

## Answer

The sample mean is **unbiased**, meaning that if we could take infinitely many samples and calculate the mean for each one, the average of all those sample means would exactly equal the population mean. This property holds regardless of sample size or the shape of the population distribution—it's assumption-free except for requiring that the population mean is finite.

### Understanding Unbiasedness

An estimator is **unbiased** if its expected value equals the parameter it's trying to estimate. For the sample mean $\bar{Y}$ estimating the population mean $\mu$, we want to show:

$$
E[\bar{Y}] = \mu
$$

This is a powerful property because it guarantees that our estimator has no systematic tendency to overestimate or underestimate the true parameter. Some samples will give us values above $\mu$, others below, but on average—across infinitely many samples—we hit the target exactly.

### The Proof

The proof is remarkably elegant. Let's work through it step by step.

We start with the definition of the sample mean:

$$
\bar{Y} = \frac{Y_1 + Y_2 + \cdots + Y_n}{n}
$$
