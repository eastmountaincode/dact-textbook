# Callout Examples

This chapter demonstrates the available callout styles.

## Original Callouts

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Question
What is the expected value of a fair die roll?
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
The expected value is 3.5, calculated as (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6.
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Definition
The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Important Distinction
Correlation does not imply causation.
:::

## Berkeley Callouts

### Pedagogical (Gold)

::: {.callout-pedagogical}
## Question
What is probability?
:::

::: {.callout-pedagogical collapse="true"}
## Answer
Probability is a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty.
:::

### Foundational (Berkeley Blue)

::: {.callout-foundational}
## Definition
A **random variable** is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space.
:::

::: {.callout-foundational}
## Theorem
The sum of probabilities in a sample space equals 1.
:::

### Insights (Sather Gate Green)

::: {.callout-insights}
## Key Insight
Linearity of expectation holds regardless of whether variables are independent.
:::

### Motivation (Lawrence Cyan)

::: {.callout-motivation}
## Why This Matters
Understanding sampling distributions is fundamental to all of inferential statistics.
:::

### Examples (Bay Fog Grey)

::: {.callout-examples}
## Example
After 10 heads in a row, the probability of tails on the next flip is still 0.5.
:::

### Cautions (Rose Garden Pink)

::: {.callout-cautions}
## Caution
Do not apply the Central Limit Theorem with sample sizes less than 30 unless the population is approximately normal.
